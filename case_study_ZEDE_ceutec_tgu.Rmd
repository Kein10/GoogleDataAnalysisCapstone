# Scenario

A group research was carried out for the subject Research Methodology during the period of September 2021, in this research a survey was applied that was answered randomly by students of Ceutec Tegucigalpa through a form that obtained 41 responses related to their perception of the ZEDE law.

Firstly, accordin to Wikipedia, Zone for Employment and Economic Development (Spanish: Zonas de empleo y desarrollo económico, or ZEDE) is the name of a new type of administrative division in Honduras (colloquially called a model city) that is subject under the national government and provides a high level of autonomy with its own political system, at a judicial, economic and administrative level.

```{r}
# install libraries
required_packages <- c('MASS', 'rcompanion', 'lsr', 'vcd', 'DescTools')
for (p in required_packages) {
  if(!require(p,character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(p, dep = TRUE)
  }
}
```

```{r}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(hablar)
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
```

### Sort and filter

```{r}
# Column names changed to English and altered to a standardised format
colnames(perception) <- c('timestamp', 'acceptance_ceutec', 'education_improve', 'in_favour', 'enrolled_ceutec', 'out_college', 'most_benefited', 'social_class_benefited', 'per_students_affected', 'cultural_relevance', 'investment_increase', 'how_informed', 'age_range','college_per', 'marital_status', 'gender')
  

perception <- perception %>% 
  select(-timestamp)
  
perception <- perception %>%
  filter(enrolled_ceutec != "") %>% 
  filter(out_college != "Nunca") # Filtrar aquellos que Nunca han sido estudiantes


glimpse(perception)
```

### Credibility

The main problem is the sample size, currently 30 observations.

Let's say Ceutec TGU has 8000 thousand students and we want a 90% confidence level, we need a sample with 262 observations.

```{r}
# A sample size calculator function for R [http://news.mrdwab.com/post/sample-size-calculator/]

sample.size = function(c.lev, margin=.5,
                       c.interval=.05, population) {
  z.val = qnorm(.5+c.lev/200)
  ss = (z.val^2 * margin * (1-margin))/c.interval^2
  p.ss = round((ss/(1 + ((ss-1)/population))), digits=0)
  METHOD = paste("Recommended sample size for a population of ",
                 population, " at a ", c.lev,
                 "% confidence level", sep = "")
  structure(list(Population = population,
                 "Confidence level" = c.lev,
                 "Margin of error" = c.interval,
                 "Response distribution" = margin,
                 "Recommended sample size" = p.ss,
                 method = METHOD),
            class = "power.htest")
}

sample.size(90, , , 8000)

```

The sample may also be unrepresentative due to non-response and convenience biases, given the way the form was shared and that respondents were those who were interested. I will therefore proceed to analyse the sample in order to practice, but it is **not** significant for the population.

## Process

```{r}

perception$in_favour[perception$in_favour == "Si"] <- TRUE
perception$in_favour[perception$in_favour == "Nunca"] <- FALSE
perception$in_favour[perception$in_favour == "No"] <- FALSE
perception$in_favour[perception$in_favour == "Talvez"] <- NA

perception$enrolled_ceutec[perception$enrolled_ceutec == "Si"] <- TRUE
perception$enrolled_ceutec[perception$enrolled_ceutec == "No"] <- FALSE


```

Change data types

```{r}
perception <- perception %>% 
  convert(lgl(in_favour, enrolled_ceutec), fct(acceptance_ceutec, education_improve, out_college, most_benefited, social_class_benefited, per_students_affected, cultural_relevance, investment_increase, how_informed, age_range, college_per, marital_status, gender))%>% 
  arrange(desc(college_per))

glimpse(perception)

```

## Analyze

### Summarising categorical variables

```{r}
cat_per <- perception %>% 
  select(-in_favour, -enrolled_ceutec)

cat_prop <- function(col){
  # Returns proportions of categorical data in column
   round(100*prop.table(table(col)), digits = 2)
}

print_pro <- function(tbl){
    for(i in 1:ncol(tbl)){
      print(colnames(tbl[i]))
      tbl[i] %>% 
      cat_prop() %>% 
      print()
      
      print("······································································")
    }
  }


print_pro(perception)

```

### Demographic statistics

```{r}
ggplot(perception) +
 aes(x = marital_status, fill = gender) +
 geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
 scale_fill_manual(values = c(Femenino = "#8E0152", 
Masculino = "#276419")) +
 labs(title = "Marital Status", subtitle = "Married vs Single", caption = "The majority is represented by single men") +
 theme_gray()
```

```{r}
ggplot(perception) +
  aes(x = age_range) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", fill = "#112446") +
  labs(
    x = "Age Range",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Age distribution"
  ) +
  theme_gray()

```

```{r}
ggplot(perception) +
  aes(x = college_per, colour = age_range) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#112446") +
  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "College Percentage Completed",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Percentage of college completed",
    subtitle = "Segmentation by age range",
    color = "Age Range"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Contingency Tables - Education

100% of those who own as "Acceptance Ceutec" in "Exce, consider that there will be a 100% improvement in education.

```{r}
cross <- table(cat_per$acceptance_ceutec, cat_per$education_improve)
round(100 * prop.table(cross, 2), digits = 1)

barplot(prop.table(cross,2) * 100, xlab = "Acceptance Ceutec", ylab = "Education Improvement", main = "Acceptance Ceutec by Education Improvement", beside = T, col=c("green",  "red","yellow"), legend = rownames(cross), args.legend = list(x = "topleft"))

```

In the sample there is only one observation where the Ceutec acceptance is considered excellent, then it is to question and probe in the form filling.

```{r}
cat_per %>% 
  filter(acceptance_ceutec=="Excelente")
```

## Share

```{r}

ggplot(cat_per) +
 aes(x = most_benefited, fill = social_class_benefited) +
 geom_bar() +
 scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "viridis", 
 direction = 1) +
 labs(x = "Most Benefited", y = "Count", title = "Most benefited by Age Range", subtitle = "Segmentation by Social Class Benefited", 
 caption = "It is notable that the \"Most benefited\" results in \"None\", however at the level of \"Most benefited Social Class\" it is the \"Low Level\" that takes the largest share among the three age ranges.", 
 fill = "Social Class benefited") +
 theme_minimal() +
 facet_wrap(vars(age_range))
```

There are no discernible patterns correlating demographic attributes with ZEDE status. However, there are the following findings.

-   The approval of the ZEDE law is, in the majority, negative.
    -   0. 85.71% is against the ZEDE law.
    -   Acceptance for Ceutec is poor at 73.33%.
    -   The improvement of education is considered null by 66.67% and little by 30%.
    -   The most benefited by is considered to be None with 66.67%.
    -   Growth in investment (the main reason for the law) is at 46.7% with respect to the option "0% to 20%).

-  Cultural relevance is estimated at "Low" with 73%, which points to public inactivity regarding the law.



## Act
1. It is necessary to acquire a larger sample for better analysis.
2. The findings demonstrate the public considerations on the ZEDE law.
3. The next steps I propose is to establish more observations for the sample (300) by sharing the form on social media.
4. I assume it is relevant to ask in the survey "Which social class do you consider you belong to?" to correlate susceptibility to who benefits the most and the acceptance of the law.
